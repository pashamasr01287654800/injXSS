# injXSS
injXSS.sh is a powerful and comprehensive payload generator designed for penetration testers and security researchers. This script provides a categorized and detailed collection of payloads for web security testing, covering SQL Injection, XSS, JavaScript Injection, HTML Injection, Phishing, Command/System Injection. Itâ€™s an indispensable tool for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and server configurations.

Features

SQL Injection Payloads
Efficiently test database vulnerabilities using a variety of payloads, including:

Classic SQL Injection: Exploit OR conditions for authentication bypass or data retrieval.

Union-Based Injection: Retrieve data using UNION SELECT techniques.

Error-Based Injection: Extract information through database error messages.

Blind SQL Injection: Test without visible feedback using Boolean or Time-based methods.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads
Exploit client-side vulnerabilities with payloads such as:

Reflected XSS: Inject malicious scripts through query parameters or user input.

Stored XSS: Exploit persistent injection points to deliver malicious scripts to other users.

DOM-Based XSS: Manipulate the DOM to execute scripts dynamically.

Advanced XSS Techniques: Bypass Content Security Policies (CSP), attack modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., AngularJS, ReactJS), and steal cookies.

JavaScript Injection Payloads
Generate payloads for browser-based attacks, including:

Manipulate DOM Elements: Exploit document.write and eval.

Session and Local Storage Attacks: Extract sensitive session or local data.

Cross-Origin Requests: Send malicious XMLHttpRequests or hijack WebSocket connections.

Dynamic Payloads: Trigger JavaScript code through event listeners or hidden elements.

HTML Injection Payloads
Simulate malicious input to test HTML vulnerabilities:

Create fake forms, inject malicious tags like <iframe>, , and <script>.

Exploit SVG, CSS, and image attributes to execute hidden attacks.

Simulate phishing through HTML manipulation of visible elements.

Phishing Payloads
Design realistic phishing scenarios to assess user awareness:

Fake login forms for social media, email, banking, or cloud platforms.

Pages mimicking payment gateways and account recovery.

Embed malicious file upload forms to compromise user data.

Command & System Injection Payloads
Test server-side vulnerabilities, including:

Execute system commands on Linux and Windows.

Manipulate and retrieve sensitive server files, such as /etc/passwd or database configurations.
